### For Reading
The relevant code in this repository is organized by two types of files: `#include`ed c++ header files (`.hpp`) in the "include" folder, and their corresponding c++ source files (`.cpp`) in the "src" folder. All of the files not in the "include" or "src" folders are only used for compiling/downloading the code to the robot.
